QRl
===

QRl is a small bookmarklet to show the URL of the current page as a QR Code. This might be useful if you want to browse the page you viewing using your smartphone for example.

To install [visit this page](http://stroebjo.github.com/qrl/).

How it works
------------

It just calls the [Google Charts API](http://code.google.com/apis/chart/infographics/docs/qr_codes.html) and inserts the QR Code image as overlay into the current page. Nothing more. :)
